# Great Recursive Conversions

For this project you will create two methods that convert to and from a binary search tree.  One will create a balanced BST starting from an array.  The other will relink the nodes of a BST so that they form a linked list with elements following the inorder traversal of the original tree.  (The tree itself is destroyed by this process.)

## Array to BinaryTree

Write your conversion function as a constructor to class `BinaryTree` that takes the array to be converted.  Your function will then call a recursive helper.  This helper will accept a sorted array, plus low and high index numbers.  It will only pay attention to the portion of the array between the low index (included in the range) and the high index (excluded).  With these elements it will build a balanced binary tree by splitting the active portion around its middle element (called the pivot) and recursively calling itself on the subranges remaining on either side of the pivot.

If you have also completed the BST project, you can add a version of your method as a constructor for class `BST`.

## BinaryTree to Linked List

To make this work, the `DLL` class included here needs to be modified so that it uses `BinaryTree` nodes as its list nodes.  You'll need to replace all the appearances of `NodeDL` with `BinaryTree`, and also substitute `getLeft` and `getRight` for `getPrevious` and `getNext`.  You can remove the `NodeDL` class entirely when this is done. 

The conversion then follows a simple recursive process:  get lists for the left and right subtrees.  Form a new list by sticking them together with the root node in the middle between the two sides, and return the result.

You should test both of your methods thoroughly to see that they work
