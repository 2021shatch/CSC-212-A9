It was interesting to see the past assigments showing up and trying to add to the class that we implemented in the past. 

Did we really need a heap class for heap sorting in place? It feels like it would have been easier to implement it directly in array instead of building a heap object. It seems more obvious to sort not in place when we have a heap object. 

Lots of recursion in this assignment. Definitely the hardest part was getting the base case right (well since the professors already gave us the next step). 

Tree to DLL and array to tree was lots of recursion. I wonder for tree to DLL if we could implements a method to get DLL in different ways
