## Reflection

Okay, this assignment was nice because we had a ton of flexibility. Plus, it was easy to work on it with a group because each mini project highlighted one our group member's best skill so we kind of just all helped each other based on our strong suits. 

For me, I worked on the Better Binary Search Tree portion of the assignment, because I knew that was what I was struggling with most. I am really not that great with understanding BSTs as well as their rotations, so this was a great way to exercise that muscle for me. 

The first day I took a look at it, I was really struggling because I didn't really know where to start. 

Okay coming back to this. It was AWFUL. At first I thought, "maybe this isn't too bad". IT WAS THAT BAD. This assignment was under the guise of being cutesey, but it was actually really hard. I really struggled with the BST section, especially with the call signatures we were given. I really wanted to include the node to start from for the lookup and insert methods. I think it would have made it much more straightforward and clean. 

Anyways, besides the self-referential issue, insert and lookup weren't too bad. Deletion on the other hand, AWFUL. Rotations were a close second. 

The thing I struggled with most was imagining all of the edge cases and again making sure that it fit the call signature. Rotations really weren't that bad, I just had a really hard time understanding what it was conceptually which made things very difficult for me. After I figured it out, though, like I said, it wasn't too bad. 

In summation, this assignment broke me. Summer here I come.
