## Reflection

Okay, this assignment was nice because we had a ton of flexibility. Plus, it was easy to work on it with a group because each mini project highlighted one our group member's best skill so we kind of just all helped each other based on our strong suits. 

For me, I worked on the Better Binary Search Tree portion of the assignment, because I knew that was what I was struggling with most. I am really not that great with understanding BSTs as well as their rotations, so this was a great way to exercise that muscle for me. 

The first day I took a look at it, I was really struggling because I didn't really know where to start.
